I did not use very much AI for this project compared to what the Lab Requirements listed. I reused the code shown in the video for the basic Alpine API call and called an ingredient list from the DummyJSON site about making some cookies. I also found another website (fakestoreapi). It has a very similar dictionary-like structure that I called the "image" of from the specified id's URL for each of the computer parts.

The first thing I asked ChatGPT-4 to do for me was to write the code for the Alpine loop for iterating through the list of ingredients for the chocolate chip cookies. The main usage I had of ChatGPT-4 was to determine the syntax of the Tailwind styling. It took a bit of work to find that you called an absolute pixel size as -[100px] as well as margins. This saved a ton of time compared to combing through the documentation for Tailwind as the site was mostly about "fancier" methods from a first glance.

Overall, the AI tool saved me time but I did not use it for any meaningful purpose.
